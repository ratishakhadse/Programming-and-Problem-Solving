## Problem Statement
Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number n using loops.

---

## Algorithm
1. Start.  
2. Read a number n from the user.
3. If n < 0
    → Print "Factorial not defined for negative numbers"
    → Stop
4. Set fact = 1
5. Set i = 1
6. Repeat while i ≤ n
    → fact = fact × i
    → i = i + 1

7. Print "Factorial of n is fact"
8. Stop.
